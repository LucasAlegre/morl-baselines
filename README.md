# MORL-Baselines

<!-- start elevator-pitch -->

MORL-Baselines is a library of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms.
This repository aims to contain reliable MORL algorithms implementations in PyTorch.

It strictly follows [MO-Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/mo-gymnasium) API, which differs from the standard [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) API only in that the environment returns a numpy array as the reward.

For details on multi-objective MDPs (MOMDPs) and other MORL definitions, we suggest reading [A practical guide to multi-objective reinforcement learning and planning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10458-022-09552-y).

A tutorial on MO-Gymnasium and MORL-Baselines is also available: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ByjuUp8-CJeh1giPOACqPGiglPxDnlSq?usp=sharing)

:warning: Some of the algorithms have limited features.

<b id="f1">1</b>: Currently, PGMORL is limited to environments with 2 objectives.

<b id="f2">2</b>: PCN assumes environments with deterministic transitions.

## Benchmarking

<!-- start benchmark -->
MORL-Baselines participates to [Open RL Benchmark](https://github.com/openrlbenchmark/openrlbenchmark) which contains tracked experiments from popular RL libraries such as [cleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) and [Stable Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).


We have run experiments of our algorithms on various environments from [MO-Gymnasium](https://www.github.com/Farama-Foundation/mo-gymnasium). The results can be found here: https://wandb.ai/openrlbenchmark/MORL-Baselines. An issue tracking all the settings is available at [#43](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/morl-baselines/issues/43). Some design documentation for the experimentation protocol are also available on our [Documentation website](https://lucasalegre.github.io/morl-baselines/algos/performances/).

## Structure

<!-- start structure -->
As much as possible, this repo tries to follow the single-file implementation rule for all algorithms. The repo's structure is as follows:

* `examples/` contains a set of examples to use MORL Baselines with [MO-Gymnasium](https://www.github.com/Farama-Foundation/mo-gymnasium) environments.
* `common/` contains the implementation recurring concepts: replay buffers, neural nets, etc. See the [documentation](https://lucasalegre.github.io/morl-baselines/) for more details.
* `multi_policy/` contains the implementations of multi-policy algorithms.
* `single_policy/` contains the implementations of single-policy algorithms (ESR and SER).
